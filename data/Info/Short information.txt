Amsterdam (/ˈæmstərdæm/, UK also /ˌæmstərˈdæm/; Dutch: [ɑmstərˈdɑm] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital city and
most populous municipality of the Netherlands. Its status as the capital is mandated by the Constitution of the
Netherlands, although it is not the seat of the government, which is The Hague. Amsterdam has a population of 866,737
within the city proper, 1,380,872 in the urban area and 2,410,960 in the metropolitan area. The city is located in the
province of North Holland in the west of the country but is not its capital, which is Haarlem. The Amsterdam
metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, which
has a population of approximately 8.1 million.

Amsterdam's name derives from Amstelredamme, indicative of the city's origin around a dam in the river Amstel.
Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in
the world during the Dutch Golden Age (17th century), as a result of its innovative developments in trade. During that
time, the city was the leading centre for finance and trade. In the 19th and 20th centuries the city expanded, and many
new neighbourhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19–20th century
Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Since the annexation of the municipality of Sloten in
1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, the oldest historic part of the city lies in Sloten, dating to the 9th century.
